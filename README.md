# Background Remover using Python

This project is a simple Python script that removes the background from an image using the `rembg` library and OpenCV. It processes an image file and saves the output as a transparent PNG file.

## Features
- Removes background from any image automatically
- Uses OpenCV for image processing
- Supports various image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Outputs images with a transparent background
- Simple and lightweight script

## Use Cases
- Creating product images with transparent backgrounds for e-commerce
- Removing backgrounds for profile pictures or graphic design
- Extracting objects from images for further editing
- Preprocessing images for AI/ML applications

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy rembg
```

## How to Use

1. Place your input image (e.g., `input.jpg`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python background_remover.py
```

3. The processed image with the background removed will be saved as `output.png`.

## Notes
- Ensure the input image exists before running the script.
- The output image will have a transparent background if supported by the format (e.g., PNG).
- You can modify the script to process multiple images in a batch.
